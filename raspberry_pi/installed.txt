installed:

python (3.9 to match local conda)
python3-pip


to install:
USBmount forked from rbrito
SystemD Script to recieve UART


UART SOLUTION:

Ok the solution was two part. first added the line suggested by @PrintedWeezl dtoverlay=disable-bt at the end of the 
config.txt file. then used putty to connect to the pi, did sudo raspi-config and followed the instructions given by 
@OutsourcedGuru " just go into sudo raspi-config , go to Interfaces -> Serial and answer "no", "yes" to the 
next two prompts." then clicked finish rebooted and it works :slight_smile:


SO! in raspi config we enable serial but have NO console. all else disabled...
